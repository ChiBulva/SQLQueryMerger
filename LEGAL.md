\## Description



The SQL Merger Tool is a general-purpose software utility designed to streamline the process of extracting, combining, and exporting data from multiple SQL sources.



Key features include:

\- Support for \*\*multiple database connections\*\* with independent authentication credentials

\- Ability to \*\*import and map data\*\* from separate schemas or tables

\- Logic for \*\*merging datasets\*\* into unified outputs for analysis or transfer

\- Export capabilities to generate clean files for external use in analytics or reporting tools



This tool was designed to solve the recurring problem of fragmented, siloed data sources that require manual extraction and cleanup. It can operate across virtually any industry or environment where relational databases are used.

\- All development work was conducted using \*\*my own tooling and paid resources\*\*, such as GitHub Copilot.

\- No proprietary code or company-specific logic is embedded in the system.

\- It is architected for \*\*broad, general-purpose use\*\*, and is not tied to any internal infrastructure or dataset.
